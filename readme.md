# Pi Weather Station Enhanced

This is an enhanced weather station designed to be used with a Raspberry Pi on 5" 800x600 touchscreens.

![pi-weather-station](pi-weather-station-v2-august2025.png)

The weather station uses the free [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API for weather data (no API key required) and optionally requires API keys from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for map tiles. You can also use an API key from [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/) to perform reverse geocoding.

Weather maps are provided by the [RainViewer](https://www.rainviewer.com/) API, which generously does not require an [API key](https://www.rainviewer.com/api.html). The map displays current precipitation radar data only (animation functionality removed for simplicity).

Sunrise and Sunset times are provided by [Sunrise-Sunset](https://sunrise-sunset.org/), which generously does not require an [API key](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api).

> The weather station will periodically make API calls to get weather updates throughout the day. Open-Meteo is free and unlimited, but be mindful of Mapbox usage limits if scrolling around the map frequently.

# Enhanced Features

- **Free Weather API**: Open-Meteo API (no key required) with RainViewer radar overlay
- **Touch-Optimized Interface**: Simplified design for 5" 800x600 touchscreens  
- **System Monitoring**: CPU temperature monitoring with color-coded alerts
- **Automatic Dark Mode**: Switches based on sunrise/sunset times
- **Interactive Screensaver**: One-click toggle with burn-in protection
- **4-Day Forecast**: Future-focused weather planning

# Setup

> You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

To install, clone the repo and run

    $ npm install

Start the server with

    $ npm start

Now set point your browser to `http://localhost:8080` and put it in full screen mode (`F11` in Chromium).

For optimal experience on Raspberry Pi touchscreens, launch Chromium in kiosk mode:

    $ DISPLAY=:0 chromium-browser --start-fullscreen --kiosk http://localhost:8080

## Production Setup (Raspberry Pi)

For automatic startup on boot, use the included systemd services:

    $ sudo cp pi-weather-station.service /etc/systemd/system/
    $ sudo cp pi-weather-kiosk.service /etc/systemd/system/
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    $ sudo systemctl enable pi-weather-station.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable pi-weather-kiosk.service

# Settings

- **API Keys**: Mapbox token required for maps, LocationIQ token optional for location names
- **Custom Location**: Set latitude/longitude if auto-detection fails
- **Simplified Interface**: Fixed units (¬∞C, m/s, mm, 24h) and screensaver settings (1hr/2min)
- Access via gear button (‚öôÔ∏è) in top-right corner

# Control Buttons

Located in the top-left corner for easy touchscreen access:
- **üß≠ Location Reset**: Return map to current/default position
- **üìç Marker Toggle**: Show/hide location marker on map
- **ON/OFF Mouse**: Toggle mouse cursor visibility (replaces radar animation)
- **üåì Theme**: Cycle through Light ‚Üí Dark ‚Üí Auto modes (auto indicated by red border)
- **‚öôÔ∏è Settings**: Open configuration panel

# Recent Updates (August 2025)

- **Simplified Interface**: Removed unit toggles and complex screensaver options
- **Interactive Controls**: Clickable screensaver toggle showing countdown or "OFF"  
- **CPU Temperature Alerts**: Color-coded monitoring (white/yellow/red)
- **Touch Optimizations**: Larger buttons, better spacing, enhanced readability
- **Fixed Parameters**: Standardized units and screensaver timing for consistency
- **Radar Simplification**: Removed animation controls - map shows current weather radar only
- **Mouse Control**: Moved from settings to dedicated ON/OFF button in control panel
